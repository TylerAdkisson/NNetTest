# Neural Network Test Project #

This is a collection of code from when I decided to learn how artificial neural networks worked.  It's nothing fancy, just code that allows 
you to build simple neural networks capable of learning simple non-linear functions (like XOR), and even very basic image processing.
Neurons use the hyperbolic tangent as their activation function. Backpropagation is the only implemented training algorithm.

Note: The code has had minimal cleaning, and is a bit of a mess.
